## Technical Implementation

### Backend API Endpoints

```

```

### Database Schema

}
```

### Frontend Components

1. **HRDashboard.js** - Main dashboard for job role overview
2. **HRAnalytics.js** - Comprehensive analytics and management interface
3. **JobRoleManagement.js** - Modal dialog for creating/editing job roles
4. **jobRoleService.js** - API service for job role operations

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Job Role

1. Navigate to **HR Management** in the main navigation
2. Click **"Create Job Role"** button
3. Select a job type from the dropdown (or choose "Custom Role")
4. Fill in the job role name and description
5. Configure confidence levels using the interactive sliders:
   - Adjust voice and hand confidence as needed
   - Eye confidence is automatically calculated to ensure 100% total
6. Click **"Create Job Role"** to save

### Predefined Job Types

| Job Type | Voice | Hand | Eye | Use Case |
|----------|-------|------|-----|----------|
| Software Engineer | 20% | 30% | 50% | Technical roles requiring strong visual focus |
| Data Scientist | 25% | 25% | 50% | Analytical roles with balanced communication |
| Product Manager | 40% | 20% | 40% | Leadership roles requiring strong communication |
| UI/UX Designer | 15% | 45% | 40% | Creative roles emphasizing gesture and visual skills |
| Sales Representative | 50% | 20% | 30% | Communication-focused roles |
| Marketing Specialist | 35% | 25% | 40% | Balanced communication and creativity |

### Assigning Job Roles to Interviews

1. When creating a new interview, select a job role from the dropdown
2. The interview will automatically inherit the confidence level requirements
3. During the interview, candidate performance will be evaluated against these criteria
4. Post-interview analytics will show how well the candidate met the requirements

## Configuration

### Default Confidence Levels

The system provides sensible defaults for common job types, but HR professionals can customize these based on their specific requirements:

```javascript
const defaults = {
  'software_engineer': { voice: 20, hand: 30, eye: 50 },
  'data_scientist': { voice: 25, hand: 25, eye: 50 },
  'product_manager': { voice: 40, hand: 20, eye: 40 },
  'designer': { voice: 15, hand: 45, eye: 40 },
  'sales': { voice: 50, hand: 20, eye: 30 },
  'marketing': { voice: 35, hand: 25, eye: 40 }
};
```

### Validation Rules

- Total confidence levels must equal exactly 100%
- Individual confidence levels must be between 0-100%
- Job role names and descriptions are required
- Eye confidence is auto-calculated if not explicitly set

## Integration with Existing System

### Interview Creation

### Real-time Analysis

- HR can track how well candidates meet role-specific requirements
- Historical data helps refine confidence level requirements

## Testing

Run the test script to verify API functionality:

```bash
cd backend
python test_job_roles.py
```

The test script covers:
- Job role CRUD operations
- Confidence level validation
- Auto-calculation of eye confidence
- Error handling and edge cases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Confidence levels don't sum to 100%**
   - Check that all three sliders are properly configured
   - Ensure eye confidence is not manually set when voice/hand are configured

2. **Job roles not appearing in interview creation**
   - Verify job roles are marked as active
   - Check user permissions and data loading

3. **API errors during job role creation**
   - Ensure backend server is running
   - Check Firebase configuration and permissions
   - Verify user authentication
